/*
 * Car Vending Machine Program - Iteration 02
 * ------------------------------------------
 * This is an updated version of the Car Vending Machine project. 
 * In this iteration, we moved from using a 2D array to a LinkedList 
 * for storing car objects, making the system more flexible and dynamic. 
 * We also added a HashMap to keep track of car locations, and used 
 * an abstract Car class with two types of cars: Basic and Premium.
 *
 * New features include searching cars by manufacturer and type, 
 * sorting the inventory by price or year, adding cars to a car wash queue, 
 * and selling (removing) cars from the machine.
 *
 * Everything runs through a menu system, and cars are still loaded 
 * from a text file at the start.
